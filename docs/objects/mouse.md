# Mouse Object

The Mouse Object is used as a user playable character, meant to be used in conjunction with the [Maze Object](maze.md). The name 'mouse' is a little unintuitive of a name, but the origin of the name is based off the idea of a mouse trying to navigate a maze. The Mouse API supports two modes: Top down mode and first person mode. This is demonstrated in the [Maze Demo](https://stephen010x.github.io/projects/webgl-c-frame/maze).
