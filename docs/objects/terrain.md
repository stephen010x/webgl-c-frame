# Terrain Object

The Terrain Object generates custom terrain meshes with normals of any specified size through a sinusoidal formula. The terrain generation is customizable through a terrain generation descriptor, which can account for a massive variety of terrains. Though this method of generation can be quite slow, each vertex in the heightmap can be generated independantly from each-other, which can lead to certain advantages in optimization. This object is demonstrated in the [Terrain Demo](https://stephen010x.github.io/projects/webgl-c-frame/terrain).
