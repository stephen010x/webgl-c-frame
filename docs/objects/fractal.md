# Fractal Object

The Fractal Object is for rendering fractals to the screen. By itself this object is primarily just a rectangle that gets drawn to the screen, and it largely relies on a fragment shader to actually draw the fractal to the screen. This is demonstrated in the [Fractal Demo](https://stephen010x.github.io/projects/webgl-c-frame/fractal)
