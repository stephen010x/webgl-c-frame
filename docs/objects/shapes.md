# Shapes Object

The Shapes Object is a collection of common shapes that can be rendered to the screen. This bypasses the need for creating or generating a mesh on the premise that you are using a common reusable shape as a model. These shapes include rectangle planes, rectangular prisms, circular planes, spheres, and a legacy texture plane that can be used in conjunction with the [DrawSurface Object](drawsurface.md).
