# WebGL C Frame Documentation

## About

WebGL C Frame, or "WebGL C Framework", is a small WebGL and WebASM 3D engine built around WebGL and [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/). This API is written in C, for C. It is intended to be compiled with Emscripten's compiler, [emcc](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html). This ultimately allows for a fast and optimized multi-platform browser-based 3D or 2D games to be developed and compiled into WebASM and JavaScript.
