# Shader API

The Shader API is an abstraction for shader objects. It provides simple and abstracted ways to populate uniform variables in the shader, as well as provides a callback for a function to render all models that intend to use a specific shader, along with a few other helper functions that get utilized by various other core APIs, such as the [Model API](model.md).
