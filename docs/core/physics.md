# Physics API

The Physics API is a legacy API for sphere-on-sphere collision interactions. It was generally used for the [Bouncing Balls Demo](stephen010x.github.io/projects/webgl-c-frame/balls), but it suffered from various collision jitter and instability, and was eventually left behind as a legacy feature, with the intention of replacing it with a more robust and versatile physics collision API.

The documentation has yet to be written. Please refer to the source files listed above.
