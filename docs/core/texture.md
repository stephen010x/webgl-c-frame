# Texture API

The Texture API provides an easy way to bind multiple textures to shaders, as well as helper functions that utilize the [Files API](files.md) to load images, and process them into uncompressed formats to be pushed to VRAM, as well as functions for generating stylized mipmaps. The features of this API are best utilized and demonstrated by the [Terrain Demo](https://stephen010x.github.io/projects/webgl-c-frame/terrain).
