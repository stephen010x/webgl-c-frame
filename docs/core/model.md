# Model API

The Model API includes objects for both Meshes and Models, which provides a useful abstraction for rendering vertices and indices to the screen. Meshes range in several different modes and data packing formats, including 2D vertices, 3D vertices, normal vectors, and texture coordinates. This API abstracts a lot of the OpenGL interactions such that the programmer no longer has to worry about them, and can focus on actual game development.
