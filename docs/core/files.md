# Files API

The Files API provides simple and concise ways to load files from the web, as well as cache and store files locally on the client, through [Emscripten's Syncronous File System API](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/emscripten.h.html#pseudo-synchronous-functions). This API also includes an OBJ file parser with the help of the [tinyobjloader Library](https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader).
